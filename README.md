ReRe is a pioneering protocol fostering the Web3 cultural shift towards regeneration. Embracing abundance over scarcity, it nurtures collaboration, community, and sustainability. Through daily online gatherings and weekly updates, ReRe catalyzes partnerships among diverse socio-environmental projects in Brazil. It amplifies impact, promoting a solar-punk vision of cities thriving in harmony with nature.

What is abundant to you?

What is scarce to you?

From these questions, a new organism has been evolving.
Ubiquitous, critical, and questioning...

**Nice to meet you, we are ReRe - Regenerative Resources!**

Since 2022, ReRe's activities have intensified, expressed through daily online meetings, event participation and organization, resource allocation to different network projects, mutual technological integration among projects, as well as the construction of collective intelligence...

These meetings are divided into spaces for the origination of proofs of concept, value propositions, and critical mapping of projects through debates, theoretical and practical explorations on Web3 and ReFi. Relating the respective challenges and abundances of each community, person, and/or initiative involved. In this way, it has been possible to effectively disseminate Web3 concepts and fundamentals because participants can envision and experiment with their own ways of applying the concepts within their reality.

For over a year, through the critical mapping of projects involved in ReRe, participants have been able to learn about the concept of Web3, exchange experiences, discover the regenerative ecosystem in Brazil, and learn good practices for strengthening the common good. Still expressing itself as a "hyperobject", in the past year, ReRe has brought innovative and positive impact results, acting as a catalyst for regenerative protagonism.

We activate interconnections between initiatives from various sectors and develop coordinated practices by creating the first "Common Pool of Shared Resources". We aim to create a Common Pool with all types of resources, including fiduciary and crypto, but not limited to them, from an equity perspective.

This network experiment has dared to expand the concept of ReFi to ReRe - beyond finances, other regenerative resources according to the paradigm of abundance, emergence of complexity, and deep regeneration associated with P2P and Common Good paradigms of distributed technologies.

Incubated projects or those participating in the ReRe network expand their initiatives to the Web3 environment, adding multidisciplinary knowledge with impact in different sectors (education, tourism, agroecology, games, production and distribution of food/herbal products, agroecological/circular economy, networked glocal entrepreneurship, angel investment, etc.)

ReRe is no longer just a "hyperobject", it has evolved as a "Regenerative Web3 Cultural Protocol" and has been expressed as a stimulating community environment, as fertile ground for collaborative innovation.

Therefore, we operate with active learning of deep regeneration applied to the ethos of Web3/dWeb, with debates and practices that rethink the traditional organizational paradigm (top-down, concentrated, linear, static, and based on scarcity logic) common in the Web2 environment, thus proposing new ways of making it complex, distributed, glocal, interactive, and collaborative - resonant with Web3 technologies and all their disruptive potential from the abundance perspective. We redistribute resources through "Common Pools" to the various projects that collaborate with this regenerative cultural protocol in a networked manner.

We do not crystallize a closed definition of what ReRe is because as a living and dynamic project created in a network, sustained even by the paradigm of complexity and interactivity, we are in a permanent process of evolution and resignification...
