# CPoSR - Common Pool of Shareable Resources

This network experiment has dared to expand the concept of ReFi to ReRe - beyond finances, other regenerative resources according to the paradigm of abundance, emergence of complexity, and deep regeneration associated with P2P and Common Good paradigms of distributed technologies.

Incubated projects or those participating in the ReRe network expand their initiatives to the Web3 environment, adding multidisciplinary knowledge with impact in different sectors (education, tourism, agroecology, games, production and distribution of food/herbal products, agroecological/circular economy, networked glocal entrepreneurship, angel investment, etc.)

We aim to redistribute resources through "Common Pools" to the various projects that collaborate with this regenerative cultural protocol in a networked manner.
